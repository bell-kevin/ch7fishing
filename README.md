# ch7fishing

Write a program that simulates a fishing game. A six-sided die is rolled to determine what the user caught. Each possible item is worth a certain number of fishing points. The user can fish as many times as they want, and each time, a message displays to tell them what they caught and the number of points earned. When the user is done fishing, a message is displayed congratulating the user depending on the number of fishing points gained.

You may select the fishing experience and points for each value on the die. Create a Word or text document that lists all the information. For example:

     Roll a 1: caught a small fish, 2 points
     
     Roll a 2: caught a medium fish, 4 points
     
     Roll a 3: caught a big fish, 6 points
     
     Roll a 4: fish took the bait, lose 2 points
     
     Roll a 5: caught an old shoe, 0 points
     
     Roll a 6: line got tangled and broke, lose 1 point
     

Use a loop to let the user fish as many times as they choose. You may select the results for total points. For example:

     Points >= 20: great day
     
     Points >= 8: fair day
     
     Points >= 0: didn't do so well
     
     Points < 0: bad day

Add this information for the results of the day to the document you created for the fishing experience information.

Create a class for the roll of the die, which uses a random number -- be sure to set the seed. Write the complete class file inside the project file (don't create a separate header file).

Run the program multiple times, enough to demonstrate each of the 6 results from rolling the die (the fishing experience), and to demonstrate the 4 options for the results of the day. Take screenshots that show all of these situations. For example, if you fish 5 times and get 3 different results, a screenshot of that execution shows 3 of the 6 fishing experiences (random number options).

Here is an example that demonstrates 4 of the 6 possible options (the fishing experience) listed above:

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing the document listing the fishing experiences and the results of a day, all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
